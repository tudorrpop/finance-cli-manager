# Personal Finance CLI Manager

What I’ve successfully built so far:

* A functional TUI dashboard using tview
* A tab-based layout:
  * Budgets - view, edit, add, and delete budgets
  * Notifications - placeholder for budget alerts and limit warnings
  * Transactions - currently working on CSV/OFX import & processing
* Fully working CRUD dialogs inside the TUI (add, update, delete)
* Smart Tab key behavior:
  * Switches between tabs when no dialogs are open
  * Switches between fields when inside a dialog
* Layout - some things centered nicely, some… well, they resisted :)
* I used mysql, but will switch to sqlite
* I started with the CLI before doing the TUI thing, so I also have working commands like budget add, budget list, etc.
